- 👋 Hi, I’m @foxtrott49,
- 👀 I’m interested in music and fps games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning. Yeah, I'm learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to not collaborate. I barely even know coding and I don't even know why am I here.
- 📫 How to reach me is to not trying to reach me. And if you somehow found me, congratulations and I won't even read or hear your message.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/His/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I sometimes have a good humor and sarcasm on one day, but sometimes I have a bad one. I also have Alexithymia, Social and severe anxiety, BPD, ADHD, and PTSD. I am also introverted.
